<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">A Guide for New Members</H1>

<H3>Welcome to UKGPL</H3> 

<P>The first thing you will need to do is Register on our forums.  Once you have registered, go to our <A HREF="http://www.simracing.org.uk/smf/index.php?topic=6787.0">New Drivers</A> thread in the Announcements section which contains a guide to getting started and is the place to get help and advice when starting with UKGPL.</P>

<H3>IRC/WinVROC/IGOR</H3>

<P>You will also need either an IRC client, or a copy of <A HREF="http://www.vroc.net/"> WinVROC</A> or <A HREF="http://gem.ebi-service.de/">IGOR</A>.  Before the races we normally meet in the UKGPL chatroom (the VROC and IGOR chat rooms are actually IRC channels on <A HREF="http://www.shadowworld.net/"> ShadowWorld</A>). It's passworded - you should get the password when you join the forums.</P>

<P>If you use IRC, you can still join the race server without WinVROC/IGOR by typing the IP address directly into GPL.</P>

<H3>Tuned hardware</H3>

<P>Make sure you can get a steady 36 frames per second when running GPL online (or as close as your hardware allows). If you get less, it will compromise the quality of your connection and will spoil the racing for both you and other competitors.</P>

<H3>Tuned connection</H3>

<P>Finally, you need a <B>good quality connection</B>. The central driving force behind the creation of UKGPL was the idea that by restricting the series to UK-based drivers and using a UK-based server, we could keep connection quality up and latency down to enjoy high quality racing, greatly reducing the warping and clock smashes which characterize GPL internet play.   However with the faster connection speeds afforded by modern broadband facilites we can now welcome drivers worldwide but he race times will be best suited to UK based drivers.</P>
