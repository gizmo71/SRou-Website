<H1>The UK Grand Prix Legends Championships</H1>

<P>This is the home page of UKGPL, a United Kingdom based online racing league for fans of Grand Prix Legends.</P>

<H1><IMG WIDTH="630" HEIGHT="393" SRC="/images/S16_CC_R8.jpg"></H1>

<H1>Registration for Season 31 is OPEN!<br>
Don't miss out!</H1>

<P align="justify">
The league is still going strong despite the advent of dozens of new sims.
Although many other games cater to online racing they often try to model every era. Grand Prix Legends simply models the best cars of the late sixties and does it exceptionally well. GPL still attracts a loyal following and UKGPL offers the opportunity to race in cars from the 1967 season and in addition offers mods that simulate the 1965, 1966 and 1969 seasons. The GT, 67 F2 cars and the Can-Ams prove that the community still has some life in it yet!</p>

<P align="justify">
UKGPL is founded around our 1967 format championship which represents the pinnacle of achievement. This coming season UKGPL will run a 1967 F1 championship to commemorate the 50th Anniversary. We will also run championships for 1965, 1966 and a Specials Series involving a mixture of 66 CanAm, 67F2 and 1969 (extra) cars.  
Our aim is simply to have some fun racing those 1960s brutes.</p>

<P align="justify">
We are now an international league having drivers from many countries but races are run at times most suited to UK based drivers.
There is something to suit everyone, both newcomers to online racing and those more experienced, so join our forum introduce yourself and enjoy the racing.</P>
