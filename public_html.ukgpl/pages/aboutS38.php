<H1>The UK Grand Prix Legends Championships</H1>

<P>This is the home page of UKGPL, a United Kingdom based online racing league for fans of Grand Prix Legends.</P>

<H1><IMG WIDTH="800" HEIGHT="351" SRC="/images/F2_Goodwood.jpg"></H1>

<H1>Registration for Season 38 is OPEN!<br></H1>
<H2>This season we will be offering something for everyone. From the older 1955 GP machines through the 1965, 1966, 1967, 1968 and 1969 open wheel single seaters to the 1967 Sports Cars. We will run a variety of race lengths with shorter sprint races and longer Grand Prix distance events.</H2>

<P align="justify">
The league is still going strong despite the advent of dozens of new sims. Grand Prix Legends models some of the best cars from the fifties, sixties and early seventies and does it exceptionally well. Despite having been around since 1998, Grand Prix Legends still attracts a loyal following and UKGPL offers the opportunity to race open wheel cars from the original 1967 season and cars from the 1955, 1965, 1966, 1968 and 1969 seasons. The 67 Sports Cars, 66 Can-Ams and 71 Can-Ams provide an additional challenge.</p>

<P align="justify">
UKGPL is founded around our 1967 format championship which represents the pinnacle of achievement and this season we will be running three divisions for the 1967 F1 cars. Two divisions will involve 50 minute Sprint races whilst the other will involve 90 minute Grand Prix distance races. UKGPL will also run championships for the 1955 GP, 1965 F1, 1967 Sports Cars and a mixed championship featuring rounds for the 1965 F1, 1966 F1, 1967 F2, 1968 F1 and 1969 F1 Cars. Our aim is simply to have some fun racing the 50s and 60s machines.</p>

<P align="justify">
We are now an international league having drivers from many countries. Our 67F1 championship will again be a joint venture with GPL Brazil. We used the UKGPL token format and scoring system last season, so this time we will be using the GPL Brazil chassis bonus system for the "Works" and "Privateer" Sprint races.

There is something to suit everyone, both newcomers to online racing and those more experienced, so join our forum introduce yourself and enjoy the racing.</P>

<P align="justify">
In order to allow drivers to plan their sim racing activities, we have adopted a regular calendar for UKGPL races. We will run two seasons per calendar year. The "Spring" season of ten rounds will start on the second Sunday of the year and the "Autumn" season will start in July so that a season of ten rounds can be completed before the end of the calendar year. The "Joe Shaw Memorial" races will be held in the week after the Easter holidays.</p>	

<P align="justify">
<H1>The provisional dates for future events are:</H1>
<H2>Joe Shaw Memorial Races: 11th April 2021 and 13th April 2021</H2>
<H2>Season 39: Start 4th July 2021 - Finish 21st December 2021</H2>
<P align="center">Summer Break: Start 28th July 2021 - Finish 4th September 2021</p>
