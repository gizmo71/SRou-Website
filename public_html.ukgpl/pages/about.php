The league is still going strong despite the advent of dozens of new sims. Grand Prix Legends models some of the best cars from the fifties, sixties and early seventies and does it exceptionally well. Despite having been around since 1998, Grand Prix Legends still attracts a loyal following and UKGPL offers the opportunity to race open wheel cars from the original 1967 season and cars from the 1955, 1965, 1966, 1968 and 1969 seasons. The 67 Sports Cars, 66 Can-Ams and 71 Can-Ams provide an additional challenge.</p>

<P align="justify">
UKGPL is founded around our 1967 format championship which represents the pinnacle of achievement and this season we will be running two divisions for the 1967 F1 cars. UKGPL will also run championships for the 1955 GP, 1966 F1, 1967 Sports Cars and a variety of Ferrari cars. Our aim is simply to have some fun racing the 50s, 60s and 70s machines.</p>

<P align="justify">
We are now an international league having drivers from many countries. A summary of our rules are available in

<A HREF="//www.simracing.org.uk/smf/index.php?topic=29321.msg562761#msg562761">German</A>. Our 1967 F1 championship will again be a joint venture with GPL Brazil. We used the GPL Brazil chassis usage format last season, so this time we will be using the UKGPL token system for the 1967 F1 "Works" and "Privateer" races.
