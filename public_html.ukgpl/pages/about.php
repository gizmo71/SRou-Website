<P align="justify">
The league is still going strong despite the advent of dozens of new sims. Grand Prix Legends models some of the best cars from the fifties, sixties and early seventies and does it exceptionally well. Despite having been around since 1998, Grand Prix Legends still attracts a loyal following and UKGPL offers the opportunity to race open wheel cars from the original 1967 season and cars from the 1955, 1965, 1966, 1968 and 1969 seasons. The 67 Sports Cars, 66 Can-Ams and 71 Can-Ams provide an additional challenge.</p>

<P align="justify">
UKGPL is founded around our 1967 format championship which represents the pinnacle of achievement and this season we will be running two divisions for the 1967 F1 cars. UKGPL will also run championships for the 1955 GP, Mixed Open Wheel (1965, 1966 and 1968 F1 cars) and the 1971 Can-Am cars. Our aim is simply to have some fun racing the 50s and 60s machines.</p>

<P align="justify">
We are now an international league having drivers from many countries. A summary of our rules are available in
