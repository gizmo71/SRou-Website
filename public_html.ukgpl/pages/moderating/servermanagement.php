<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Server Management</H1>

<P>Server management can be split into two distinct aspects.  The first is associated with server preparation and the other with hosting races.</P>

<H2>Server Preparation</H2>

<p>Server preparation includes tasks such as loading tracks, setting race lengths and installing loose grids e.t.c.  Most of these tasks are equally applicable to regular user installations so details of how to install tracks and loose grids will not be explained indepth.  The explanations provided for user installations is generally sufficient.  

Paul Jackson's loose grids are available <a href="../../files/Loose_grids.zip">here</a>.  Setting race lengths to those other than the standard short, long and Grand Prix distances is not usually undertaken by users so details on how to modify the race length can be found <a href="modracedistance">here</a>.</p>

<H2>Hosting Races</H2>

<p>The method of hosting races depends on whether this is done remotely or locally and if it is done under VROC or IGOR.  Remote hosting is normally invoked where a dedicated server is being used that has a static IP address and is permanently connected to the internet via a commercial ISDN or ADSL installation.  Local hosting is normally used where racers use a PC in their own home with a shared internet connection via a router with a dynamic rather than static IP address.  More information on starting a server remotely using VROC or IGOR can be found <a href="remotehosting">here</a>.  Guidance on how to set up a server for local hosting can be found <a href="localhosting">here</a>.</p>
