<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Court System</H1>

<p>UKGPL uses the SRou court system to manage incident reports.  The court system allows drivers to submit incident reports in private for consideration by the moderating team. 
	The Divisional Moderator is responsible for collating the incident reports, analysing the incidents and compiling a report but invariably he will ask for second opinions from
	 the other moderators thereby ensuring a balanced and well reasoned report.</p>
	 
<p>Moderating races is not easy but the task can be made less arduous if drivers submit accurate and informative incident reports. Understanding how the court system works should help 
	drivers compose better incident reports.</p>

<p>1. After the race results are imported into SRou, a results table appears on the race thread.  Under the results table is a hyper-link which allows the drivers  
	to submit incident reports:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><img border="0" src="/images/court/submit_report.jpg" width="424" height="144"></p>
      <p></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>2. The incident report form is self explanatory.  The important point to note is that the details are only visible to the moderating team not to the other drivers. 
	This ensures drivers can be open and honest without the possibility of causing offence or disagreements on the drivers forum. It is for the moderator to decide 
	what to do about the incident once the views of all the drivers who have submitted the reports has been taken into account.  It is helpful if drivers enter the time 
	at which the incident occurred in the format &#42&#42h&#42&#42m&#42&#42s because that is the format used in GPL Replays and it ensures the various reports can be 
	associated with the correct incident.</p>

    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>

<p>3. After the drivers have been given enough time to submit incident reports (normally about a week) the divisional moderator will go into the court system and begin the moderation 
	process by selecting the race from the court.</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p><img border="0" src="/images/court/court_list.jpg" width="1084" height="724"></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>4. Once the moderation process is underway the drivers cannot submit any more incident reports and a notice to that effect appears under the results table.</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p><img border="0" src="/images/court/provisional_results_notice.jpg" width="424" height="82"></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>5. There is a moderator's forum that is not accessible to the drivers. A significant amount of discussion can go on behind the scenes.  Moderator's reports are 
	normally the result of discussions between several moderators however the final decision on the content of the report rests with the divisional moderator. The driver's
	submissions are taken into account during the discussions.  The moderators are not obliged to to take into account posts on the race thread, in fact arguments and 
	abusive posts are likely to be ignored.  However, incident reports submitted through the court system are taken very seriously.  So if you want to help the moderators 
	produce high quality, balanced and fair reports, please use the Court System and refrain from starting arguments or making accusations on the driver's forum.</p>

<p>6. Once the divisional moderator has finished consulting the other moderators and is happy with the report he will publish and the results become official.  The moderator's 
	report appears on the race thread under the results table.</p>
