<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Local Hosting</H1>

<P>Local hosting is when the user interacts with the server directly rather than via a remote interface. Local hosting 
can be achieved through the GPL Multiplayer Interface, VROC or iGOR. Where several computers on a home LAN use the same internet connection, the router is assigned the internet IP address and data is passed to the computers on the Local Area Network (LAN) by the router using the port forwarding protocol.</P>

<H2>GPL Multiplayer Interface</H2>

<p>The GPL multiplayer screen provides all the functionality necessary to host multiplayer games. Locally hosted races appear in the "Local Games" section of the GPL Multiplayer window. If port forwarding has been implemented in the router, 
it is possible to join a multiplayer game using the internet IP address of the router. However, it is not possible to browse for remotely hosted races using the GPL Multiplayer Interface. Only games hosted on the same LAN appear in the "Local Games" section. So in order to join the server, drivers need to know what the router internet IP address is and what time the server will be started.</p>

<H2>VROC</H2>

<p>UKGPL no longer host races with VROC so this section is obsolete.</p>

<H2>IGOR</H2>

<p>In order to ensure GPL is configured with the correct parameters (e.g. the 60fps patch), iGOR should only be started via
 the GEM interface. Full instructions are <A HREF="localhostingigor">here</A>.</p>

<H2>Configuring a Router for Local Hosting</H2>

<p>There is no need to change any router settings in order to host races on a LAN. However to host races that can be 
accessed by drivers over the internet, specific ports need to be configured in the router to faciliate the connections. This 
process is called Port Forwarding. Details on how to achieve this is <A HREF="localhostingrouter">here</A>.</p>
