<H1>The UK Grand Prix Legends Championships</H1>

<P>This is the home page of UKGPL, a United Kingdom based online racing league for fans of Grand Prix Legends.</P>

<H1><IMG WIDTH="804" HEIGHT="492" SRC="/images/55GP_Grenzlandring.jpg"></H1>

<H1>Registration for Season 36 is OPEN!<br></H1>
<H2>This season we will be running some of our favourite open wheel cars from 1955, 1966, 1967 and 1969.</H2>

<P align="justify">
The league is still going strong despite the advent of dozens of new sims.
Although many other games cater to online racing they often try to model every era. Grand Prix Legends simply models the best cars of the late sixties and does it exceptionally well. GPL still attracts a loyal following and UKGPL offers the opportunity to race in cars from the 1967 season and in addition offers mods that simulate the 1955, 1965, 1966 and 1969 seasons. The GT, 67 F2 cars, the 66 Can-Ams, 71 Can-Ams, 55 Grand Prix and now the Sports Cars Extra mod prove that the community still has some life in it yet!</p>

<P align="justify">
UKGPL is founded around our 1967 format championship which represents the pinnacle of achievement and this season we will be running two divisions for the 1967 F1 cars. UKGPL will also run championships for the 1955 GP, 1966 F1, 1967 F1 and 1969 F1 Cars. Our aim is simply to have some fun racing the 50s and 60s machines.</p>

<P align="justify">
We are now an international league having drivers from many countries. In fact, this season our 67F1 championship will be a joint venture with GPL Brazil. 
To foster a spirit of collaboration, we have adopted new rules which combine the characteristics of both leagues so both the UKGPL and GPL Brazil drivers should be comfortable with the new format.
There is something to suit everyone, both newcomers to online racing and those more experienced, so join our forum introduce yourself and enjoy the racing.</P>

<P align="justify">
In order to allow drivers to plan their sim racing activities, we are moving to a regular calendar for UKGPL races. We will run two seasons per calendar year. The "Spring" season of ten rounds will start on the second Sunday of the year and the "Autumn" season will start in July so that a season of ten rounds can be completed before the end of the calendar year. The "Joe Shaw Memorial" races will be held in the week after the Easter holidays.</p>	

<P align="justify">
<H1>The provisional dates for future events are:</H1>
<H2>Joe Shaw Memorial Races: 19th April 2020 and 21st April 2020</H2>
<H2>Season 37: Start 6th July 2020 - Finish 16th December 2020</H2>
<P align="center">Summer Break: Start 13th August 2020 - Finish 13th September 2020</p>
