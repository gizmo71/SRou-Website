<h2>Yellow Card Example</h2>

<P>A warning is worth 1 yellow card point. A penalty is worth 2 yellow card points.  Each incident is assessed on it's own merits; the severity of previous incidents are not considered when determining whether or not an incident constitutes a warning, a penalty or simply a caution.</P>

<P>Every 2 yellow card points a driver has above 2 will automatically incur an extra lost place on subsequent penalties and warnings.</P>

<P>So to take an example (rather extreme but it illustrates the mechanism):
<BR/>
<BR/>Race 1.
<BR/>Offence 1, WARNING given, no penalty
<BR/> driver has 1 yellow card point
<BR/>Offence 2, PENALTY given, 2 places lost
<BR/> driver has 3 yellow card points
<BR/>Offence 3, WARNING given, no penalty
<BR/> driver has 4 yellow card points
<BR/>
<BR/>Race 2.
<BR/>Offence 1, WARNING given, 1 place lost for previous yellow card points
<BR/> driver has 5 yellow card points<BR/>
Offence 2, CAUTION given, no places lost for previous yellow card points
<BR/> driver has 5 yellow card points<BR/>
Offence 3, PENALTY given, 2 places lost + 1 extra for the 5 yellow card points = 3 places
<BR/> driver has 7 yellow card points
<BR/>
<BR/>Race 3.
<BR/>Offence 1, WARNING given, 2 places lost for the 7 yellow card points
<BR/> driver has 8 yellow card points
<BR/>Offence 2, PENALTY given, 2 places + 3 extra for the 8 yellow card points = 5 places
<BR/> driver has 10 yellow card points
<BR/>
<BR/>(Total of 13 places lost)</P>

<P>It may be easier (at least for the footballing fraternity) to think of a red card being equal to 2 yellow cards.  Drivers effectively get a yellow card for a warning and a red card for a penalty.  Each red card a driver holds amounts to an extra place penalty for subsequent warnings and penalties.</P>
