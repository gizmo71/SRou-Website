<H3>Ignoring Blue Flags</H3>

<P>Moderating this issue is complicated by the fact that blue flags are not
recorded on the replays. Consequently moderators need to use discretion in
all cases.

<h4>Typical Scenarios:</h4>

<P>Deliberately Ignoring Blue Flags: Penalty 2 places
<ol>
  <li>The lapped driver clearly ignored the blue flags on several occasions.
    Good opportunities to let the lapping driver through were ignored. The lapping driver had not been lost by the server (hence blue flags and
    pit board signals were valid). The lapped driver should have reasonably expected another car to be behind and much quicker at this stage in the
    race.</li>
