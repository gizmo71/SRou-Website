<H3>Failing to take Stop &amp; Go after Shift-R</H3>

<P>The driver may be entitled to a No Fault Shift R and the penalty waived.

<P>
Typical cases where this might apply are: 
<ol>
  <li> Massive warp, causing a car to appear suddenly in front of or on top of
the victim's car.</li>
  <li> A blatant rear end shunt where the victim had been in complete control
of the car up to the impact.</li>
  <li> Another car suddenly rejoins the track without warning, leaving no
opportunity for the victim to take evasive action.</li>
  <li> The victim is hit by a flying or bouncing, etc, loose canon car that was
involved in its own or other incident but collected the victim as well.</li>
</ol>
 Cases where it would <b>NOT</b>  apply are:
<ol>
  <li> A racing incident; for example, the driver is knocked off the track
during an overtake.</li>
  <li> An incident occurs ahead which the victim runs into.</li>
  <li> The victim is rear ended after partly losing control into/during
a corner. <I>Losing control</I> here means running significantly wide,
getting sideways and scrubbing off much more speed than usual, etc.</li>
  <li> The driver makes a mistake on their own, for example, blowing their engine
  or crashing after a loss of control.</li>
</ol>
