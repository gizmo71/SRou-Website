<H1>Automatic Race Ban Example</H1>

<P>A driver has amassed 4 yellow card points in division A, 3 yellow card points in division B and 2 yellow card points in division C; a total of 9 yellow card points.  He then picks up 2 more yellow card points for 2 separate incidents in the next division A race.</P>  

<P>Having amassed 10 yellow card points after the first incident a suspended race ban is invoked for the yellow card point awarded for the second incident.  The driver now races under a suspended ban for the next 3 division A races.  Any races the driver enters in the other divisions will also be under the suspended ban.  So if he picks up another yellow card point in a division B race whilst the suspension is in force, then a 1 race ban will be invoked in division A.  This will also generate a second suspended race ban, but this time for division B.</P>

<P>Before the next 3 division A races or next 3 division B races are concluded; the driver then enters a division C race and picks up yet another yellow card point.  This generates a second race ban in division A, a race ban in division B and a suspended race ban in division C.</P>
