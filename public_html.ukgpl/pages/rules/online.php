<OL>

<LI><P>When joining a race, please use a driver name which is easily
recognisable so that we can keep the score sheet accurate, eg. Marc
Mercer could use Marc2 Mercer, Marc Mercer2 or something similar.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>If GPL is not recording the driver's lap times in qualifying, they may disconnect then reconnect using a different helmet colour; this may solve the problem.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI><P>Once the driver has entered the server their car choice is
made. They may not exit and change car after they have joined the
server. The only exception to this is if WinVROC, IGOR or the driver
accidentally selects the wrong car. In this case they must exit
<I>immediately</I> (without driving any laps) and change to the
correct car.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Any driver who sets a time and then changes car will be 
penalized. Please see the <a HREF="contravene_online">Penalty
  Guidelines</a> for more details.</BLOCKQUOTE>

</OL>

<a id="chat"><H2>In-game chat</H2></a>

<OL>

<LI><P>As a general rule, chat is <B>not</B> allowed during league
races, except after all drivers on track have passed the chequered
flag. This applies to both qualification and race sessions.</P>

<LI><P>The only exceptions to this are "PO" or similar for exiting the
pits, "PI" for entering the pits and "S" to apologize after an
accident.  Even using "S" after an accident is not encouraged; a
driver should be able to apologize after the race, any unnecessary
chatting is distracting to the other drivers.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Drivers should not forget that when they have
finished their race it will usually be another minute or two before
all the other drivers have finished theirs, so they should not start
chatting before everyone has finished.</BLOCKQUOTE>

</OL>

<a id="network"><H2>Timing and scoring mistakes caused by network problems</H2></a>

This section is intended to ensure that no driver is
unnecessarily penalized by internet problems such as warp and clock
smashes.

<OL>

<LI><P>If a driver gains pole position (or another artificially high
grid slot) because of a warp, they are not required to forfeit this
position.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>A driver who finds themselves in an unexpectedly
high grid slot is expected to exercise great caution at the start,
where faster drivers may be "bottled up" behind
them.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI><P>If a driver receives an <I>undeserved black flag</I> (that is,
a black flag because of a network problem) or is lost by the server,
they may choose to ignore this and continue racing. After the race,
they should inform the moderator, who will check the replay and
reinstate them in the results as appropriate.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Drivers who have been disqualified or forgotten by
the server should remember that other drivers will not see them on
their lap boards, nor be shown blue flags if they are being lapped,
and should adjust their expectations of other drivers' behaviour
towards them accordingly.</BLOCKQUOTE>
