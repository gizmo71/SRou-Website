<H3>Lack of Care Approaching an Incident</H3>

<P>This can be a very difficult situation to moderate. Lack of care
generally corresponds with speed approaching an incident. It should be
obvious from the replay whether or not a driver slowed down but much more
difficult to ascertain the visibility of the yellow flags.

<P>The key features to consider here are:<UL>
<LI> Was a yellow flag not seen or unclear/v small?
<LI> Was a very slow or stopped car visible?
<LI> Did the unexpected happen?
<LI> Did the driver slow down or modify his line to account for the incident?
</UL>

<h4>Typical Scenarios:</h4>

<P>Total Lack of Care:  Penalty 3 Places
<ol>
  <li>The yellow flags were clearly visible. The cars and debris from the incident were clearly visible.
    The cars from the incident were either stationary or moving very slowly.
    The approaching driver made no attempt to slow down and contact was made
    with the cars from the incident.</li>
</ol>

<P>Blatant Lack of Care:  Penalty 2 Places
<ol>
  <li>The yellow flags were clearly visible. The cars and debris from the incident were clearly visible.
    The cars from the incident were moving or would clearly need to reset to continue.
    The approaching driver made no attempt to slow down and contact was made
    with the cars from the incident.</li>
</ol>

<P>Simple Lack of Care:  Penalty 1 Place
<ol>
  <li>The yellow flags were clearly visible. The approaching driver was unsighted because of circuit topography, other
    cars or bandwidth limitations (i.e. number of cars that are visible). The cars from the incident were moving or would clearly need to reset to continue.
    The approaching driver made no attempt to slow down and contact was made
    with the cars from the incident.</li>
</ol>

<P>Marginal Lack of Care:  Warning
<ol>
  <li>The yellow flags were clearly visible. The approaching driver was unsighted because of circuit topography, other
    cars or bandwidth limitations (i.e. number of cars that are visible). The cars from the incident were moving or would clearly need to reset to continue.
    The approaching driver slowed down but contact was made with the cars from
    the incident.</li>
</ol>

<P>Avoidable Lack of Care:  Typical Caution
<ol>
  <li>The yellow flags were difficult to see. The approaching driver was unsighted because of circuit topography, other
  cars or bandwidth limitations (i.e. number of cars that are visible). The cars from the incident were resetting or driving unpredictably.
    The approaching driver slowed down but contact was made with the cars from
  the incident.</li>
</ol>

<P>No Lack of Care:  No Penalty - Racing Incident
<ol>
  <li>The yellow flags were not visible. The approaching driver was unsighted because of circuit topography, other
    cars or bandwidth limitations (i.e. number of cars that are visible).</li>
  <li>The yellow flags were difficult to see. The approaching driver was unsighted because of circuit topography, other
  cars or bandwidth limitations (i.e. number of cars that are visible). The cars from the incident were resetting or driving unpredictably.
    The approaching driver slowed down appreciably but contact was made with the
  cars from the incident.</li>
