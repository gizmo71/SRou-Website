<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Racing Etiquette</H1>

<H2>General</H2>

<UL>
<LI><P>Repeated poor driving standards will not be tolerated. Racing
accidents can and will happen, it is aggressive driving incidents
which can be avoided that will be penalised. The final decision is up
to the moderator of each division.</P>

<LI><P>All drivers are expected to familiarise themselves with the
GPLAC <A HREF="/rec_dvr_beh/rec_driver_beh.htm" TARGET="_top">
Recommended Driver Behaviour</A>.</P>

<LI><P>When starting, each driver must make sure they keep their car straight
and fully in control.</P>

<LI><P>Drivers must remember that their tyres are cold on lap 1. They should
not attempt any overtaking moves unless they are <I>sure</I> it is safe to
do so.</P>

<LI><P>Blocking is <I>not</I> allowed, but defensive driving <I>is</I>
allowed. If a driver moves off the racing line <I>before</I> the car
behind attempts to overtake, this is defensive driving. If they move
off the racing line <I>after</I> the car behind has started to move
across to overtake, this is <I>blocking</I>. If a driver is driving
defensively they may move off the line and back onto it only
<I>once</I> per straight/section.</P>

<LI><P>If an overtaking driver has any part of their car beside another as
they enter a corner (known as overlap), the driver being overtaken should <I>not</I> move
across; they should give the overtaking car room and go through the corner
side by side, or let them through into the corner and try to re-take them at
the exit.  Drivers must learn to judge overlap without being able to actually see 
the opposition, this requires an understanding of the limited visibility provided by the mirrors. 
As described <A HREF="overlap">here</A>.</P>

<LI><P>If a driver is following a slower car, they should remember that they
will brake earlier than the faster car.</P>

<LI><P>Any driver who, by not complying with the above rules, causes another
car to crash or take severe avoiding action may be penalised.</P>

<LI><P>Persistent driving down the centreline of the track in order to
make passing difficult is not acceptable. The moderators will take a
sensible approach in enforcing this; the idea is to stop blatant
centre line driving, not penalise every possible case. For most
drivers this rule should make racing safer as well as more fun.</P>

<LI><P>Sometimes GPL will mistakenly show a driver a black flag. For example,
a warp may cause the server to believe that the driver has cut the course. A
driver being shown a black flag by mistake is permitted to do one of two
things: <UL>
  <LI> Take the stop and go penalty.
  <LI> Carry on racing. The server will mark the driver as disqualified.
       The driver should then contact their divisional moderator after the
       race, who will examine the replay and reinstate the driver in their
       correct finishing place.
</UL>
<LI><P>Riding the kerbs is permitted but there must always be at least two wheels within the track boundary at any one time.  If three or four wheels have been placed outside the track boundary then a driver is deemed to have left the track and will subsequently have to perform a rejoin with the necessary caution this dictates.  
<UL>
<LI> If you have knowingly overdone the kerb riding or left the track for any other reason in qualifying, please abort the lap in order to not post an illegal lap time.
</UL>
</UL>

<HR WIDTH="50%">

<H2>Incidents involving other cars</H2>

<UL>

<LI><P>If a driver is involved in an incident with another car, they
must report the incident to the division moderator; failure to do so
will leave the driver with no appeal against any penalty assessed. The
driver should try to save a replay of the incident if possible, as
this will help their case.  The other moderators will then hold a
"stewards enquiry" and decide on any penalties that may be
applicable.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>If a driver hits another driver and cause an
accident, it is suggested that they do not attempt to wait for them,
as this is likely to cause more problems for drivers who are passing
the scene of the accident as two or more cars all try to rejoin "in
order".</BLOCKQUOTE>

</UL>

<HR WIDTH="50%">

<H2>Shift-R (resetting the car)</H2>

<UL>

<LI><P>Shift-R is allowed <I>only</I> in a race, not in practice.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This rule may be relaxed at certain tracks (usually only the Nurburgring).  If the rule is to be relaxed the drivers will be notified in the race post.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI><P>
Any Shift-R must be followed by a Stop and Go
(&quot;<B>S&amp;G</B>&quot;) in the pits. Any Stop and Go <I>must</I> be taken within 2 laps of
the Shift-R. A &quot;<B>S&amp;G</B>&quot; is effectively a Timed Pit Stop of zero seconds. The rules for making 
Timed Pit Stops are <A HREF="pitstops#whentoperform">here</A>. The section describing how to perform a stop is the most relevant for a Shift-R &quot;<B>S&amp;G</B>&quot;.</P>

<LI><P>Drivers should take every precaution to make sure they rejoin the
race without interfering with any other drivers. This means waiting
until there is a sufficient gap in the traffic before using
Shift-R. On lap 1 this may even mean waiting until the whole field has
passed before using Shift-R.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Any driver who, due to inappropriate use of
Shift-R, causes another car to crash or take severe avoiding action
will be penalised.</BLOCKQUOTE>

</UL>

<HR WIDTH="50%">

<H2>Rejoining the race after an incident</H2>

<UL>

<LI><P>It is the responsibility of any driver who is returning to the track
to make sure they do not interfere with other drivers.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Rejoining drivers should stay off the racing line
and give way to faster cars until they are fully up to
speed. Rejoining drivers should not attempt to keep anyone behind them
until they are fully up to speed. Any driver who rejoins a race and,
owing to negligence, causes another car to crash or take severe avoiding
action, will be penalised.</BLOCKQUOTE>

</UL>

<HR WIDTH="50%">

<H2>Lapping</H2>

<UL>
<LI><P>Any driver who is about to be lapped may not deliberately
block or race the lapping driver, and must allow the lapping driver to
pass at the first safe opportunity.</P>

<LI><P>Any driver intending to lap another car must allow for warping,
the difference in speed (especially under braking), and must execute
any pass safely and without contact.</P>

<LI><P>Any driver appearing not to be making adequate use of his rear
view mirrors, or driving in a manner which even unintentionally
appears to hinder or discourage a driver seeking to move one or more
laps ahead may be penalised.</P>

<LI><P>Any driver not showing adequate care when following or passing a
slower car they intend to lap may be penalised.</P>

</UL>

<H3>Advice for the lapped driver</H3>

<H4>Deciding on whether a car is lapping you or racing for position</H4>

<P>During the race, a blue flag in GPL indicates that the driver behind is about 
to lap you. The blue flags are usually reliable when shown and therefore should 
be obeyed unless you have good reason to believe they are wrong. Blue flags 
do not always appear however; thus, any driver has the responsibility to be 
aware of the status of a following car regardless of flag signals. There are 
plenty of indications as to whether the following driver is racing for position 
or is lapping. Ignorance is no justification for unnecessarily holding up 
a lapping driver.</P>

<P>Helpful indications include:<UL>

<LI>Pit Board &ndash; Time Difference &mdash; If the pit board shows the driver 
in the position below to be 20seconds behind and yet you have a faster car 
on your tail it is almost certain to be a lapping car Pit Board - Lap Number 
- If you are only 5 laps into a race and have not spun, the following driver 
is unlikely to be lapping you. If you are 30 laps into the race and the car 
behind is closing rapidly, it is most likely about to lap you. Before the 
race use the speed difference in qualifying to work out roughly when you first 
expect to be lapped.

<LI>Mirrors &ndash; Closing speed &mdash; If the following car it is catching 
you rapidly then it is likely to be lapping you. Use the mirrors as often 
as possible to stay aware of what is behind, since lapping drivers may close 
very fast.

</UL>

<P>How to allow a lapping car to pass cleanly:<UL>

<LI>When approached by a faster car, initially just hold your line 
to prevent any confusion A valid exception to this is where you have spotted 
the car early enough to move off the racing line before they approach you. 
Make sure that any such move is made well before the lapping car is close 
to give them plenty of time to react. If in doubt, it is best to hold your 
line.</LI>

<LI>If the faster driver then moves alongside in an attempt to 
pass, back off just very slightly to make the pass easier. Be aware in this 
situation that GPL only shows one following car in your mirrors. If the pass 
is in a corner, make sure to give as much room as possible to the other driver. 
Because of warping and your limited peripheral vision, this usually means 
running right around the outside of a corner.</LI>

<LI>If the following car does not pass you almost immediately then 
try to allow them to pass at a safe part of the circuit as soon as you can.</LI>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Suggestion 1 &mdash; as you brake for a corner stay well to the outside 
during the braking stage, then deliberately run right around the outside of 
the corner allowing the faster driver to pass on the inside line.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Suggestion 2 &mdash; as you enter a straight (as long as the
following driver is not very close behind) move away from the racing line,
then slow slightly to allow the faster driver to pass.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Following these guidelines will allow you let a driver lap 
you safely, without hindering them or yourself. At some circuits such as Monaco, 
it may require extra care to make this go smoothly. Ultimately, as long as 
you have done everything above correctly, any accident where the lapping driver 
hits the back of you is likely to be their fault.</P>
</UL>
<H3>Advice for the lapping driver</H3>

<P>The lapping driver takes the majority of the responsibility 
to make a clean pass. If you cannot see any guaranteed clean route to pass 
the driver then be patient and follow them! <B>Do not</B> make a risky move even
if it means following them for a long period. Anyone causing an accident through 
impatience will be penalised severely.</P>

<P>The lapping driver is responsible for following a slower driver 
at a safe distance. Slow down when approaching a slower car &ndash; the speed
difference may be much larger than you expect. Their lines and braking points 
may be totally different to yours and they may be more likely to make mistakes. 
Warping will also mean that you may need to leave extra room. Lapping drivers 
showing a lack of care in this situation will be penalised.</P>

<H2>Flags and Pit Signals</H2>

<H3>Deserved Black Flags</H3>

<UL>

<LI><P>A driver being shown the black flag and a "pit in" board for a
genuine offence, such as jumping the start, must enter the pits and take the
penalty. Failure to do so will result in the disqualification of that
driver.</P>

</UL>

<H3>Yellow and Green Flags</H3>

<UL>

<LI><P>Drivers have a duty to drive safely and well within their limits when
they have passed a yellow flag. Stay on the racing line unless it is
blocked. Drivers may <B>not</B> overtake any car they are racing with, until
they are sure they have passed a green flag <B>or</B> they are sure they
have passed the incident and the green flag has been taken in. (Sometimes a
yellow flag is shown when a car loses and then quickly regains control, so
the green flag may be gone by the time the driver passes the next
marshall).</P>

</UL>

<H3>Red Flag Situations</H3>

<UL>

<LI>A race will be red flagged by the moderator <B>only</B> if at least
half the drivers are disconnected from the server during lap one due to
network problems. This may mean the race will have to be rescheduled due to
time factors. Start line crashes will not be red flagged, no matter how many
cars are involved.</LI>

<LI>In the event of a mass disconnection or other server problem the
moderator may, at their discretion:<UL>
  <LI> reconstruct the result based on the replay, if available;
  <LI> declare the race to be red flagged at the end of the preceding
    lap and take the final results from that lap; or
  <LI> declare the race null and void and arrange for it to be run again.
</UL></LI>
