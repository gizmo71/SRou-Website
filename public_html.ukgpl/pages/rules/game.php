<H2>General</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Drivers must use Grand Prix Legends version 1.2.0.2 The use of the DiscoFix patch is strongly encouraged.</LI>
<BR/>
<LI>Championship races and most other league races will use bandwidth
	settings equivalent to 4 ahead and 2 behind. Drivers are required to
	download Bart Westra's <A HREF="http://www.xs4all.nl/~westrab/gpl.htm">
	BWpatch</A> - place it in the GPL directory and make sure option 1
	(&quot;more cars patch&quot;) is applied.</LI>
<BR/>
	<BLOCKQUOTE/>The easiest way to get the required patches is to use the <A HREF="http://gplps.org/"> Grand Prix Legends Preservation Society</A> installer.
	You can also download the basics from <A HREF="/files/patches/">here</A>.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR/>
<LI>Modification of the GPL executable and data files is only permitted
	if the modification does not give a performance advantage to the driver
	compared to drivers using a copy of GPL without the modification.</LI>
<BR/>
	<BLOCKQUOTE/>Note: In order to use a H-Shifter with GPL (for example the Logitech G25 or G27 shifter) the executables must be modified using  
	<A HREF="http://www.gplshift.dk/GPLshift/index.htm"> GPL Shift</A>.  Whilst the use of GPL Shift is permitted, recommendations on how it should be configured are 
	<A HREF="hshifter">here</A>.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR/>
<LI>Modifications that have only cosmetic effects are permitted. </LI>
<BR/>
<LI>Drivers are strongly discouraged from using traction or braking help
	as this severely compromises the car's performance and introduces a
	performance gap to unassisted cars which is both hazardous and not in
	keeping with UKGPL's aim of close racing.</LI>
</UL>

<H2>Cars</H2>

<UL>

<LI>Drivers must use the standard 1967 cars as supplied as part of GPL or an official add-on carset where decreed by the moderator.</LI>
<BR/>
<LI>Changing the performance or handling characteristics of any car, other than by means of the car setup, is forbidden.</LI>
<LI>Prohibited changes include, but are not limited to, the following:<UL>
	  <LI> changing an engine's power characteristics or weight
	  <LI> changing an engine's fuel consumption

	  <LI> changing a car's weight and weight distribution
	  <LI> changing a car's size
	  <LI> changing a car's basic suspension characteristics
	  <LI> changing the grip or temperature characteristics of the tyres
	</UL></LI>

<LI>A driver may change a car's setup parameters outside of the range of values permitted by GPL 1.2's built-in setup editor using one of the

</UL>

<H2>Tracks</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Modifying the graphics of a track is permitted without restriction. This includes the creation of additional brake markers.</LI>

		<LI> changing the layout of the track
		<LI> changing any part of the track surface to alter its grip characteristics
		<LI> removal or addition of trackside objects with which a car may come into contact
		<LI> changing any parameters which may affect a car's performance and handling characteristics, for example track temperature or altitude
	</UL></LI>
<BR/>
<LI>Where an add-on track is being used, if there are multiple versions of a track with different physical layouts, the race moderator will state which version must be used.</LI>
