      to pass freely to re-establish their respective positions as they were 
      before the contact. Even if the guilty driver has to let other

    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>CR-1 </b>&nbsp;You must establish 
      substantial overlap with the car ahead before they reach the corner's 
      turn-in point to have the right to drive up their inside, or to expect 
      them to leave inside room for you. Substantial overlap means at least that 
      the front of your car is up to say the driver's position in the ahead car 
      - and that's at the very least. You probably should have more overlap in 
      some circumstances. The ahead driver has the right to be fully committed 
      to the racing line of their choice without any interference if there was 
      no substantial overlap before he turned in.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>CR-2</b>&nbsp; If sufficient overlap 
      is established before the turn-in point, then the behind driver has the 
      right to sufficient side room. The ahead driver must then leave sufficient 
      side room for the behind driver.</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>CR-2-A&nbsp; </b>The car on the 
        outside has the right to outside room all the way through the corner - 
        right up to the exit point. They should not be squeezed against the 
        outside towards the exit point.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>CR-2-B </b>The car on the inside 
        has the right to inside room all the way through the corner - right up 
        to the exit point. They should not be squeezed against the inside 
        towards the apex area.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The ahead driver can still battle 
          for the position of course but must do so while maintaining side room 
          for the behind driver.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The practice of going up the inside 
          of an ahead car after they have already turned in, and where there was 
          no established substantial overlap before the turn-in point, is 
          sometimes referred to as barge passing, ( I.e. you barge your way past 
          ). Understand that barge passing is a high risk maneuver for both you 
          and others. You have no rights what-so-ever as a barge passer. Should 
          you cause an accident from a barge passing maneuver you'll be in a 
          defenseless position should you be protested.</font></p>

      </blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>CR-3</b>&nbsp; Where an ahead driver 
      has clearly made a sufficient error to warrant a passing move a behind 
      driver may attack their position, with due caution and care, regardless of 
      whether there was any pre-existing overlap.</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">E.g. - If the ahead driver brakes too 
        late and drifts out wide of the apex and then has to reduce speed etc. 
        This would be a valid passing opportunity regardless of whether there 
        was pre-existing overlap. However, there is still substantial 
        responsibility on the overtaking driver to take all necessary care to 
        avoid contact.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Small errors by the ahead driver may 
        not be sufficient to justify an attacking passing move however. Just 
        because the ahead drivers gets a bit out of shape at times doesn't give 
        you an automatic right to pass uncontested by them or a right to room. 
        You still have to judge if their error provides sufficient opportunity 
        for a safe pass to take place.</font></p>

      block an attacking car to protect their position while on a straight - but 
      then must maintain that position as long as the attacker remains affected 
      by their position. Then, naturally, as they approach the next corner, they 
      can of course return to the racing line of their choice for the corner.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">E.g. If you go wide at a corner and a 
        close behind car tries to take advantage of this by moving up the 
        inside, you should leave room for them, whether or not they had 
        pre-existing overlap going into the corner. They must leave you room as 
        well of course.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">This is a bit of a grey area and 
        requires good judgment. Small errors that don't much materially effect 
        the speed or direction of a car wouldn't count here. E.g. Simply going a 
        little wide but maintaining race speed while still half on the racing 
        line would not be enough of an error to expect this rule to apply. For 
        the behind drivers - If in doubt - don't - should apply. You can always 
        protest after the race if you think you've been wronged - but once 
        you're in the wall that's you race done - and the other guy might 
        protest you and win.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">So ... Behind drivers shouldn't push 
        your luck with this rule.</font></p>

        un-stuck, if you're still steering to an extreme angle trying to get
