<p><font face="Arial"><b><font color="#80FFFF" size="3">Stay out of the
way of drivers who are on flying laps</font></b><font
color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"> </font><font
color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">when you're on an out lap,
or any other non-useful qualifying lap for that matter. With a
full field the track can get crowed. It can be hard to find the
space to complete a clean flying lap sometimes. It's all the worse
if people who are on an out lap try to &#145;race&#146; those who
are trying to complete a clean flying lap. Be a sport. Let others
complete their flying laps as cleanly as possible.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">Also if you have
spoiled the lap you&#146;re on, ( by spinning, a really bad
section, whatever ), then also consider staying out of the way of
others for the remainder of your non-useful lap.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b><font color="#80FFFF" size="3">Exit the pits
carefully.</font></b><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">
</font><font color="#C0C0C0">Many drivers
announce their egress onto the circuit with a &#145;<strong>PO</strong>&#146;
( <strong>P</strong>it <strong>O</strong>ut ) notice though the
chat facility. This is recommended. However, such announcements
alone are not a license to charge onto the track with gay
abandonment. In addition, try to ease yourself onto the track so
that you get a view in your mirrors of what&#146;s coming up
behind.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">Some tracks are
worse than others when it comes to a clean track entrance manoeuvre. I.e. You can leave the pits at Monza at full
acceleration and drive adjacent to the main track for a few
hundred yards before actually needing to move onto the track
proper. This gives you lots of time to check your mirrors for
approaching cars. On the other hand, the pit exit at Watkins Glen
leads almost directly onto the racing line of a high speed
sliding corner. There, for example, you need to be very careful not to
interfere with someone on a flying lap.</font></p>

<hr>

<p align="center"><b><font color="#FFFF80" face="Arial">All
Sessions</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong><font color="#80FFFF" size="3">Get off
the track and out of the way ASAP if your car is non functional.
</font></strong>
<font color="#C0C0C0">If you crash,
spin out, run out of fuel, whatever, so that you&#146;re on the
track but not moving or moving very slowly for where you are,
then move off the track as quickly as you can. If in a Pro race
where a Sift-R isn't possible, retire ASAP if that's the fastest
way to clear the road in a particular circumstance. Treat this as
a matter of urgency, as if every fraction of a second counts, (
and it often does). Your race may be done but others are still
trying to compete as best they can. Running into your stationary
or slowly moving vehicle will not make their day. At the very least get away from the racing line, and do it with all
haste.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">Of course there
may be some circumstance where a damaged car might still be
capable of affording some benefit to its driver. E.g. Damage from a
crash on the last corner on the last lap may still leave a car
able to limp across the line for a beneficial result. An out of
fuel car may still be able to roll a long way to cross the line.
A damaged but still running car or engine may still be able to
carry you to some points. Common sense has to prevail of course,
and no one can expert you not to do everything reasonable to
enhance your own result. But, if your current situation is not
served by staying on the track, then please get off, and get off
as fast as you can.</font></p>

of many a racing sim, ( see below ). To state the obvious, if the
driver in front of you can&#146;t see you then don&#146;t be
surprised if they crash into you, or cut you off so you
can&#146;t avoid crashing into them. As much as you can, show
yourself in the mirrors of the car in front.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">Of course once you
decide to overtake a car you have to drive into their blind
spots. But even then, if they get a good view of what your
movements are immediately prior to your disappearing,
they&#146;ll have a much better idea of your probable position
and likely immediate actions, and what they need to do to try to
avoid contact. This is not quite the same as real life perhaps,
but real life enjoys a much better visual range.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><font color="#C0C0C0">Trying to stay
away from an opponent&#146;s mirrors may be a valid tactical
ploy. E.g. Trying to rattle them into an error by making them
guess where you are. But in </font><font color="#FFFFFF"

color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"> this is asking for
trouble. In my opinion </font><font color="#FFFFFF"

requires us to play the gentleman here, if only for our own
survival and enjoyment.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b><font color="#80FFFF" size="3">Never run into
the back of someone in front of you.</font></b><font
color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"> </font><font
color="#C0C0C0">This is probably one of the
silliest things one driver can do to another. There&#146;s few
excuses here. If you are behind then <strong>you</strong> have
the responsibility to drive in a manner that will not lead to you
running into a car ahead. It doesn't matter if you're faster,
think you have the right to be let by, are more talented, or
think that all slower drivers should not hold up faster drivers.
If you're behind someone then that's your tough luck. You have to
earn your pass the same as anyone. However frustrated you may be,
or whatever, it is <strong>your</strong> responsibility not to
run into the car in front of you. Even if their braking zones
occur earlier than yours would normally, then tough luck. You
have to anticipate these possibilities and drive accordingly.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">If you've tried
everything, braking, gearing down, changing line, etc., but can
see you're still going to collide with a car ahead, then you should drive your own car off the track, crashing
yourself out of the race if necessary, if that's what it takes to
avoid such a contact.</font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">The in-front
driver must not do malicious braking of course. I.e. Deliberately slowing down inappropriately to rattle a following
driver. They are required to drive with all haste and due
propriety. But while doing so within their limits they are
entitled not to have to worry about whether a following driver
will run into them.</font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">Being able to
follow another driver without running into then is something you
have to learn to do. It often takes keen judgment and many times
is not easy. You want to be as close as possible, to snatch a
pass if a chance comes along, but you need to be far enough away
to respond to the ahead driver's manoeuvres, evasively sometimes.
It does take practice and it is a skill. But its an essential
skill for successful enjoyable online racing. You can practice
with friends, in non-serious races, or with the AI cars offline.
Offline, pick a car that's slower than you and try to just hang on
their tail for 10 laps or so without passing. You may surprise
yourself at how much your skill in this area needs to be
improved.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong><font color="#80FFFF" size="3">Avoid close racing when
its not necessary</font></strong><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">. Not only does very close driving
give you very little time to react if the need arises, it also increases very
much the likelihood of a internet-lag-time caused collision. In GPL
online there is always a risk of registering a collision in close driving even
without any perceivable contact - due to internet lag. The closer you are to
another car the more likely this will happen. The general rule for the careful
and respectful driver would be, not to unnecessarily drive too close to another,
especially whenever there is
no point. E.g. In situations where there is no possibility of passing anyway. You're asking for trouble if you do, even if you don't actually do
anything wrong.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong><font color="#80FFFF" size="3">Use Clear Body Language</font></strong><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">.
If someone is following you closely, looking for a place to pass, and you kind of
drift along with ambiguous movements about the track, or you sort of close the
door but still leave the inside line half open, then you just might unintentionally
lure the following car to try a pass that's only half on. Alternatively, if as soon
as a following car gets anywhere near your rear quarter coming up to a corner,
and while they are still in your mirrors, you make a firm and clear movement
towards the inside line, and stick there, then they will know&nbsp; that your
intentions are to close the door and drive the defensive inside line. Such a
clear defensive move will leave them in no doubt about trying a risky inside pass.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">This is just one case. There's
others of course. The thing is ... Always try to convey a clear message by your driving
style so that surrounding drivers get a very good idea about your intentions.
Body language used well can be almost as clear as having indicators on your car.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong><font color="#80FFFF" size="3">Practice the Other Lines
Before You Have to Use Them</font></strong><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">.
If the first time you have ever tried driving around the outside of a certain
corner is in a frantic race situation when you're racing toe to toe with
someone, then you'll be in unfamiliar territory in the middle of a high stress precision
driving situation. A bad place to be. Before a race comes up, just try doing a
few laps of the circuit hugging the left-hand-side of the road all the way
around and then do a few hugging the right-hand-side. At the very least do 1 or
2 laps against each side of the road. You'll be surprised at how much less
likely you are to crash while trying to hold road position if you are at least a
little familiar with how the outer and inner lines feel.</font></font></p>

<p align="center"><b><font color="#FFFF80" face="Arial">Overtaking</font></b></p>

<p align="center"><b><font color="#FFFF80" face="Arial">The
Non Contested Pass</font></b></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">A non
contested pass is simply a pass where you're happy, for whatever
reason, to let an overtaking driver go past with the least
hindrance to them and yourself as possible. Your reasons may be that, you don't
want to risk an incident due to an overtaking battle, the
overtaking driver may be known to you as a notorious accident
causer, or you may be being lapped - in which case race etiquette
requires you to do what you can to expedite a clean quick safe
pass for the lapping driver. Whatever the reason, there may be
times when you want to let someone past uncontested.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b><font color="#C0C0C0">To
let someone past uncontested,</font></b><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><b> </b></font><font color="#80FFFF"

color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"> </font><font
color="#C0C0C0">You need to use clear body
language here. Moving from side to side trying to be helpful by staying off the
racing line, for the sake of the passing car, is the worse thing
you can do. What&#146;s important is not weather you&#146;re on
the racing line or not, but whether you&#146;re driving a
predictable line. Pick a side of the road to move to, usually the
one you&#146;re nearest to at the time, then religiously stay
against that side until the car has passed. You might even try
slowing a little to expedite the pass, as sometimes a quick pass
can benefit you as much as it does the passer. But don&#146;t
slow down too abruptly of course.</font></font></p>

        moment. This has special significance when you're being
        passed - with or without blue flags being waved.</font></font></p>
<font color="#C0C0C0"
        face="Arial">If you're being lapped, perhaps with blue
        flags but whenever, be aware there could be any number of
        lapping cars right on your gearbox even though you don't see them. What
can happen is this ... You see a car
        coming up in your mirrors, maybe you also see blue flags, you
        think &quot; there's a car lapping me I'll move over to
        let him pass&quot;, you move to one side of the road and
        let him through, you then move back onto the racing line
        and BAM, you've hit someone. It turns out there was more
        than one car lapping you. When you moved over to let the
        first one through the others tried to go through too, as
        you'd expect. But while you were on the other side of the
        road, they were out of you mirrors, you simply never got
        to see them.</font><p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">This can really take you by
        surprise, and them too. All you can do here is be as
        careful as possible, look around if you're able too, try
        to shy a glimpse,
        listen for more engine sounds, toggle the arcade view for
        a moment. They can help by trying to show themselves in
        your mirrors before going through. Be aware that just
        because you see one car go past that may not be the end
        of them. Whether after a blue flag or whenever, as the
        same limitations always apply.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0"
        face="Arial">The drivers doing the lapping / passing
        should also bear in mind these limitations. You ( passing
        drivers ) be aware that the car you're lapping may have absolutely no knowledge of your presence what-so-ever.
        Be careful. You should always try to show yourself in the mirrors of an
        ahead car before trying a pass.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><font color="#C0C0C0">The
problem with close racing of any sort, contested passing
included, is largely one of what each driver in the situation can
see of the other. Most people I've raced with are fair and don't
mean to cause accidents. Most aren't reckless. Its just that
there's a lot of guessing going on about exactly where and how
close you are to another driver. The </font><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><strong>GP</strong></font><font

answer to the problem of driving very close to other cars you
can't actually see is to drive with a lot of caution, care, and
respect for your fellow drivers. You have to use your wits and
anticipation. Most importantly, you must leave room for other
cars whenever you have reason to believe they <strong>might</strong>
be beside you. You can't wait to be sure they're beside you. By
the time you're sure, i.e. you can see them, it's too late. In my
opinion, you need to leave room simply if you have reason to
believe someone <strong>might</strong> be beside you.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">Leaving
room for another car means you'll not be driving the ideal racing
line. It also means you'll be driving a line you haven't
practiced and which is unfamiliar to you. All this means you'll
be slower through the given section than usual. This also means
that not only will the action of leaving room provide the
opportunity for an opponent to pass you, but it also enhances the
likelihood of their success - while you're in a slower-than-usual
mode of driving. But that's tough. Its just the way it is, and
frankly it's not that much a departure from real life racing in
some of these respects. All things considered, you will still
experience the best of sim racing enjoyment by always leaving
room for your opponents wherever appropriate.</font></p>

<hr>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFF80" face="Arial"><b>Things
You can do To Overcome The Blind Spots</b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">There
are a couple of things you can do to help get around the blind
spots problem. Each has its pros and cons.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFF80" face="Arial"><b>The
Look-Around Views</b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><font color="#FFFFFF">GP</font></strong><font
color="#FFFF00" face="Arial"><strong>L</strong></font><font
color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"> </font><font
color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">has a built in look-around
facility that can be assigned to operate from the keyboard or game port device buttons. When activated, the forward view slides
around to the desired direction to give you a view out the side
of the car. These views are a useful idea. No doubt they're
included due to a perceived need for some kind of enhancement to
the visual range. They can be useful but regrettably their
implementation hasn't been ideal, in my opinion.</font></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">Its
best to assign the look-around facility to spare buttons on your
control device if you have some. The B buttons for example,
assuming you're using the A buttons for gear shifting. If you
have a wheel that doesn't have the B buttons on it you might
consider attaching them yourself, a relatively simple procedure.
You can also use the keyboard but I find it nowhere near as
comfortable or as easy to use as having such buttons right under
my thumbs when I want them.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">A
problem with the look-around views are that they turn from the forward
view so much that you can no longer see forward at all when
they're selected. As you might imagine, its rather difficult to
drive a car at the bitter limit while seeing nothing but a side
view line of sight. I'd rather the view was not turned to such an
extent. Alternatively, and better still, have the degree of the
turn driver adjustable so that it can be suited to everyone's
individual tastes and tolerances.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><font color="#C0C0C0">Another
problem with the look-arounds are that they aren't instantaneous.
They slide from the forward view position to the side view
position, and visa versa when returning to the forward view. I
guess this sliding transition is to simulate the driver turning
his head. That may sound fine but it doesn't work. I suggest that
what's important here is not the aesthetic novelty of simulating
a turning head movement, but fast access to required visual
input. In my opinion, the look-around shouldn't be for simulating
a driver turning his head, but for making up for the lack of
peripheral vision that a real driver would have anyway without turning
his head. ( Most people have peripheral vision approaching 180
degrees, a much greater visual range than </font>
<font
color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><strong>GP</strong></font><font
color="#FFFF00" face="Arial"><strong>L</strong></font><font
color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"> provides). I note the
speed of the sliding motion has been greatly increased from the
first </font><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><strong>GP</strong></font><font
color="#FFFF00" face="Arial"><strong>L</strong></font><font
color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"> demo, where it was so slow
it was almost useless. But it would be improved again if it was
simply made an instant action thing rather than the way it is.</font></font></p>

<p align="left"><strong><font color="#FFFF80" face="Arial">The
Arcade View</font></strong></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">The
arcade view is available at any time during real time driving by
pressing the F10 key on the keyboard. This gives you an elevated
driver view from somewhere behind the driver looking forward.
This view also includes a good portion of the side areas that you
can't see from the cockpit view. To regain the cockpit view
simply repress the F10 key.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">The
arcade view can be very useful in a number of circumstances,
close quarter racing being one of them. Because of the extended
side views you can clearly see how close you are to other nearby
side-area cars and drive accordingly. I don't suggest you dive in
this mode on a continual basis, but for those close moments when
you're wondering where an invisible close-by car exactly is at, a
quick toggle to the arcade view to check the scene can be very
handy. You may even stay in this mode for the duration of the
close racing session. Its superior views can be quiet tempting.
Because the change to the arcade view is instantaneous, as
opposed to the sliding effect of the look-around views, it's an
easier view to transit to and from and incurs a minimum amount of
changing-view-mode disorientation.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">Using
the arcade view at the start of a race can also be a help. I.e. To
negotiate your way through the notorious start-line to first turn
chaos, or beyond.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">The
downside of using the arcade view is that it is not a realistic
view, and seems to mock the entire idea of trying to simulate the
experience of real life racing. If the whole idea of sim racing
is to perceive the moment as real racing drivers do, then driving
in, or even toggling to, an arcade view seems to blow the
illusion.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">A
minor problem is having to find the right key on the keyboard
while trying to race in a break-neck situation that necessitated
the arcade view in the first place. This can be easily overcome
however by sticking something like a small ball of BlueTack onto
the F10 key. Then you can activate it quickly and readily by feel
alone.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">Another
problem is that arcade view driving requires some practice to get
it right all in itself. You probably won't be able to jump
straight from cockpit driving to arcade driving and expect the
same degree of proficiency. This can add to the amount of overall
time required to get proficient at the sim as a whole of course,
and for many time is precious.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">Not
sure if its right to call it a downside or not, but I suppose
within the defines of the concept of pure simulation I guess it
may be. The fact is that once you get practiced at arcade driving
you may well find you can actually driver better than when in
cockpit view. You can see exactly how close your car is to the
edge of the track and use every fraction of it. From the elevated
viewpoint you can often perceive the best racing line through
corners better. You can see near-by cars much better and make
better more finely judged and executed passes and collision
avoidance maneuvers. Even when controlling slides, seeing your
whole car against a large area of road and surrounds can convey
to you a better feel for what's happening and consequently you
have more and/or better input to work with. You may find that you
can control some slides that would have been a certain crash in
cockpit mode. You don't have mirrors but this isn't the loss you
might think, especially with the increased overall views.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><font color="#C0C0C0">Once
you get arcade driving down pat, which admitably will take some
practice, you may find that you're faster, more consistent, have
less offs accidents and collisions, better starts and first
corner / first lap experiences, able to pass others easier with
less risk, able to fend off and defend against passes by others
better with less risk, finish more races without incident, and
control your slides more deftly. About the only thing against it
is that it's an unrealistic way to drive. ( In any case, I think
it'd be nice if </font><font color="#FFFFFF"
face="Arial"><strong>GP</strong></font><font color="#FFFF00" face="Arial"><strong>L</strong></font><font
color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial"> indicated to everyone if
drivers are in arcade mode or not, so at least we could compare
apples with apples ).</font></font></p>

money is the cost of repair, and real lives are at risk.</font></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">In
brief, the concept is, you must establish substantial overlap
with the car ahead before a corner's turn-in point to have the
right for room to be left for you by the ahead driver.
Substantial overlap means at least that the front of your car is
up to say the driver's position in the ahead car - and that's at
the very least. You probably should have more in many circumstances. The ahead driver has ever right to
be fully committed to the racing line of his choice without any interference if there was no overlap before he turned in.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">If
sufficient overlap is established <strong>before the turn-in
point</strong>, then the behind driver has the right to room. The
ahead driver can still battle for the place of course but must do
so from a wider-out position, leaving room for the behind driver.</font></p>

          out-sped the Eagle by any amount what-so-ever - as I hope you can see
          form this diagram. Unfortunately many drivers think that if they do
          this they are some kind of out-braking genius, when in fact they are
          not out-preforming the other driver at all.
          Its a geometric illusion that has nothing to do with a driver's ability or performance.
          If they could really out-brake the other, they would have made some
          overlap before the turn-in point, not after it.</font></font></td>

<blockquote>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">You may wonder how
this reconciles with the above regarding leaving room for cars
that disappear up your inside from your mirrors. Well ... If a
behind car doesn't have overlap before the turn-in point then
they shouldn't disappear up your inside line but stay tucked in
behind you. If they want to disappear up your inside line then
they should do so before you reach the turn-in point. If they
disappear up your inside line after the turn-in point, then its
really up to you how you play it. You may decide to enforce your
rights and risk a contact, or your may be willing ( reluctantly )
to leave room because you don't want to crash.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">An exception to this
is where an ahead driver has clearly made a sufficient error to warrant a
      passing move. Eg - they brake too late and
wash out wide of the apex and have to reduce speed etc. This would be a valid
passing opportunity regardless of whether there was pre-existing overlap.
However, there is still substantial reasonability on the overtaking driver to
take all necessary care.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">Small errors
      by the ahead driver may not be sufficient to allow a safe passing move
      however. Just because the ahead drivers gets a bit out of shape at times
      it doesn't give you an automatic right to room. You still have to judge if
      their error provides sufficient opportunity for a safe pass to take place.</font></p>

genuine overlap, in general , while

last priority is to attend to radio communications.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">In our racing
perhaps just two priorities are required. Drive your car, then
race it. Meaning, ... The first priority is to stay in control of
your car. Only after that is done do you worry about racing it
with any near-by competitors. You often see people who left alone
can drive well enough. But once they start racing they are going
into corners so deep etc they have no chance. The obvious reality
is - if you could only take a certain corner at say 80mph when
alone, you can't take it at 120mph just
because you're racing someone. Don't let the sprit and thrill of
the racing moment take your attention away from your number one
priority. Drive your car, stay in control of it. Then worry about racing.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong><font color="#80FFFF">Survive. </font> </strong>
<font color="#C0C0C0"
face="Arial">I used to race small 2-man sailing boats. These were great fun. </font></font>
<font color="#C0C0C0"
face="Arial">The
class I raced had mainsails, jibs, spinnakers, and 2 man crews.</font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0"
face="Arial">The crew had the
job, among other things, of hanging off the side of the boat, when required, via a thin wire secured
to the upper mast. In a brisk breeze, say 30 knots, on a spinnaker reach the crew
would be stretching at full extension, tip toes on the gunwale, while grasping
the leeward spinnaker sheet to keep the spinnaker in trim. Only the last couple
of feet of the aft hull would be touching the water as the small boat planned at
considerable speed across the top of the water surface. Kind of like skipping 
stones across the top of water.</font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0"
face="Arial">The whole boat would
shake and vibrate at these times. The crew's head was at maybe a few inches
above the water surface, while spray, often rather cold, drenched them to the
bone. The skipper would at these times try to keep the boat facing the optimum
angle towards the next marker, as well as trying to catch and surf down waves if
there were any as to do so would add a good deal to the boats overall speed - if you caught
them right. The skipper also tried not to turn the boat too much or too suddenly
so that wind would spill from the sails, upsetting the trapezessing crew's 
counterbalancing which would capsize the boat and throw everyone into the water 
in a great splash.</font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0"
face="Arial">I can't write this without smiling - such fun I used to have at 
this. If I let my memories take control the next few thousand words will be tall 
tales of true about sailboat racing stories.</font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">I remember attending a sailing technique
clinic once where the sailing instructor said, &quot; it does you very little
good if you win a protest but your boat is at the bottom of the ocean &quot;. In
a similar vein, it doesn't do your sim racing fun a lot of good if you keep
getting crashed out of races when in the right. More often than not, the most
fun is had by actually racing the whole race and finishing it. It's up to you how
you play it when you're in the right, but often it pays to not force issues on
the track. I've found that people who wrongly force passes etc often end up in the
ditch after a while in any case. You can then cruise past them with a big grin
on your face.</font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">There's a saying they have in
sailing. &quot; Sailing is like standing under a cold shower tearing up $100
bills&quot;. I wonder what the sim racing equivalent of this is :-)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong><font color="#80FFFF">Drive the
outside wheel</font></strong><font color="#FFFFFF"
face="Arial">. </font><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">When
cornering, or whenever your in a turning moment, if you hit a
bump or curb and the car 's going all over the place and you're
panic steering, settle your focus on the outside wheel and drive
that. Nine times out of ten you'll get control back and save
yourself. Forget about driving the car and drive the outside
wheel - the one you can see that is, the front one. Its just a
concentration focus trick but it can work, more for some than for
others.</font></font></p>

        about the usual degree of peripheral vision people have).
        What a difference this would make to the sim. In the
        example taken from above, the Lotus driver would then be
        able to see all the adjacent and in-front cars. Couldn't
        we have some rip-snorting wheel-to-wheel dices then.
